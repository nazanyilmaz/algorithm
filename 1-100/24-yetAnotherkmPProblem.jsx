// This challenge uses the famous KMP algorithm. It isn't really important to understand how KMP works, but you should understand what it calculates.

// A KMP algorithm takes a string, , of length  as input. Let's assume that the characters in  are indexed from  to ; for every prefix of , the algorithm calculates the length of its longest valid border in linear complexity. In other words, for every  (where ) it calculates the largest  (where ) such that for every  (where ) there is .

// Here is an implementation example of KMP:

// kmp[1] = 0;
// for (i = 2; i <= N; i = i + 1){
//     l = kmp[i - 1];
//     while (l > 0 && S[i] != S[l + 1]){
//         l = kmp[l];
//     }
//     if (S[i] == S[l + 1]){
//         kmp[i] = l + 1;
//     }
//     else{
//         kmp[i] = 0;
//     }
// }
// Given a sequence , construct a string, , that meets the following conditions:

// The frequency of letter '' in  is exactly , the frequency of letter '' in  is exactly , and so on.
// Let's assume characters of  are numbered from  to , where . We apply the KMP algorithm to  and get a table, , of size . You must ensure that the sum of  for all  is minimal.
// If there are multiple strings which fulfill the above conditions, print the lexicographically smallest one.

// Input Format

// A single line containing  space-separated integers describing sequence .

// Constraints

// The sum of all  will be a positive integer .
// Output Format

// Print a single string denoting .

// Sample Input

// 2 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0
// Sample Output

// aabb
// Explanation

// The output string must have two '' and two ''. There are several such strings but we must ensure that sum of  for all  is minimal. See the figure below:

// kmp(1).png

// The minimum sum is . Among all the strings that satisfy both the condition, "aabb" is the lexicographically smallest.

//Answer-24
function kmp(x) {
  // Build the string S according to the frequencies given in x
  let result = [];

  // Iterate over the frequencies and build the string
  for (let i = 0; i < x.length; i++) {
    let char = String.fromCharCode(97 + i); // 'a' has ASCII code 97
    result.push(char.repeat(x[i])); // Repeat the character x[i] times
  }

  // Join the result to form the final string
  return result.join("");
}

function main() {
  const ws = fs.createWriteStream(process.env.OUTPUT_PATH);

  const x = readLine()
    .replace(/\s+$/g, "")
    .split(" ")
    .map((xTemp) => parseInt(xTemp, 10));

  const result = kmp(x);

  ws.write(result + "\n");

  ws.end();
}
