// Johnny is playing with a large binary number, . The number is so large that it needs to be compressed into an array of integers, , where the values in even indices () represent some number of consecutive  bits and the values in odd indices () represent some number of consecutive  bits in alternating substrings of .

// For example, suppose we have array .  represents ,  represents ,  represents ,  represents , and  represents . The number of consecutive binary characters in the  substring of  corresponds to integer , as shown in this diagram:

// whats.png

// When we assemble the sequential alternating sequences of 's and 's, we get .

// We define setCount() to be the number of 's in a binary number, . Johnny wants to find a binary number, , that is the smallest binary number  where setCount() = setCount(). He then wants to compress  into an array of integers,  (in the same way that integer array  contains the compressed form of binary string ).

// Johnny isn't sure how to solve the problem. Given array , find integer array  and print its length on a new line. Then print the elements of array  as a single line of space-separated integers.

// Input Format

// The first line contains a single positive integer, , denoting the number of test cases. Each of the  subsequent lines describes a test case over  lines:

// The first line contains a single positive integer, , denoting the length of array .
// The second line contains  positive space-separated integers describing the respective elements in integer array  (i.e., ).
// Constraints

// Subtasks

// For a  score, .
// For a  score, .
// Output Format

// For each test case, print the following  lines:

// Print the length of integer array  (the array representing the compressed form of binary integer ) on a new line.
// Print each element of  as a single line of space-separated integers.
// It is guaranteed that a solution exists.

// Sample Input 0

// 1
// 5
// 4 1 3 2 4
// Sample Output 0

// 7
// 4 1 3 1 1 1 3
// Explanation 0

// , which expands to . We then find setCount() . The smallest binary number  which also has eleven 's is . This can be reduced to the integer array . This is demonstrated by the following figure:

// whats-2.png

// Having found , we print its length () as our first line of output, followed by the space-separated elements in  as our second line of output.
