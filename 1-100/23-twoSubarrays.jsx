// Consider an array, , of  integers. We define the following terms:

// Subsequence
// A subsequence of  is an array that's derived by removing zero or more elements from  without changing the order of the remaining elements. Note that a subsequence may have zero elements, and this is called the empty subsequence.

// Strictly Increasing Subsequence
// A non-empty subsequence is strictly increasing if every element of the subsequence is larger than the previous element.

// Subarray
// A subarray of  is an array consisting of a contiguous block of 's elements in the inclusive range from index  to index . Any subarray of  can be denoted by .

// The diagram below shows all possible subsequences and subarrays of :

// image

// We define the following functions:

//  = the maximum sum of some strictly increasing subsequence in subarray
// We define the goodness, , of array  to be:

// In other words,  is the maximum possible value of  for all possible subarrays of array .

// Let  be the length of the smallest subarray such that . Given , find the value of  as well as the number of subarrays such that  and , then print these respective answers as space-separated integers on a single line.

// Input Format

// The first line contains an integer, , denoting number of elements in array .
// The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective values of .

// Constraints

// Subtasks

// For the  of the maximum score:

// Output Format

// Print two space-seperated integers describing the respective values of  and the number of subarrays satisfying  and .
