// Kyle and Mike are bored on a rainy day and decide to pass the time by creating a new game having the following rules:

// The game starts with two -sized integer arrays,  and , and is played by two players,  and .
// The players move in alternating turns, with  always moving first. During each move, the current player must choose an integer, , such that . If the current player is , then  receives  points; if the current player is , then  receives  points.
// Each value of  can be chosen only once. That is, if a value of  is already chosen by some player, none of the player can re-use it. So, game always ends after  moves.
// The player with the maximum number of points wins.
// The arrays A and B are accessible to both the players P1 and P2. So the players make a optimal move at every turn.
// Given the values of , , and , can you determine the outcome of the game? Print  if  will win,  if  will win, or  if they will tie. Assume both players always move optimally.

// Input Format

// The first line of input contains a single integer, , denoting the number of test cases. Each of the  subsequent lines describes a test case. A single test case is defined over the following three lines:

// An integer, , denoting the number of elements in arrays  and .
//  space-separated integers, , where each  describes the element at index  of array .
//  space-separated integers, , where each  describes the element at index  of array .
// Constraints

// Output Format

// For each test case, print one of the following predicted outcomes of the game on a new line:

// Print  if  will win.
// Print  if  will win.
// Print  if the two players will tie.
// Sample Input

// 3
// 3
// 1 3 4
// 5 3 1
// 2
// 1 1
// 1 1
// 2
// 2 2
// 3 3
// Sample Output

// First
// Tie
// Second
// Explanation

// Test Case 0: ,  The players make the following  moves:

//  chooses  and receives  points.
//  chooses  and receives  points. Note that  will not choose , because this would cause  to win.
//  chooses  (which is the only remaining move) and receives  points.
// As all  moves have been made, the game ends. 's score is  points and 's score is  points, so  is the winner and we print  on a new line.

// Test Case 1: ,  Because both players will only make  move and all possible point values are , the players will end the game with equal scores. Thus, we print  on a new line.

// Test Case 1: ,
// Because both players will only make  move and all the possible point values for  are greater than all the possible point values for ,  will win the game. Thus, we print  on a new line.
