// Alex has a board game consisting of:

// A chip for marking his current location on the board.
//  fields numbered from  to . Each position  has a value, , denoting the next position for the chip to jump to from that field.
// A die with  faces numbered from  to . Each face  has a probability, , of being rolled.
// Alex then performs the following actions:

// Begins the game by placing the chip at a position in a field randomly and with equiprobability.
// Takes  turns; during each turn he:
// Rolls the die. We'll denote the number rolled during a turn as .
// Jumps the chip  times. Recall that each field contains a value denoting the next field number to jump to.
// After completing  turns, the game ends and he must calculate the respective probabilities for each field as to whether the game ended with the chip in that field.
// Given , , , the game board, and the probabilities for each die face, print  lines where each line  contains the probability that the chip is on field  at the end of the game.

// Note: All the probabilities in this task are rational numbers modulo . That is, if the probability can be expressed as the irreducible fraction  where , then it corresponds to the number  (or, alternatively, ). Click here to learn about Modular Multiplicative Inverse.

// Input Format

// The first line contains three space-separated integers describing the respective values of  (the number of positions),  (the number of die faces), and  (the number of turns).
// The second line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective values of each  (i.e., the index of the field that field  can transition to).
// The third line contains  space-separated integers describing the respective values of each  (where ) describing the probabilities of the faces of the -sided die.

// Constraints

// The sum of  is
// Note: The time limit for this challenge is doubled for all languages. Read more about standard time limits at our environment page.

// Output Format

// Print  lines of output in which each line  contains a single integer,  (where ), denoting the probability that the chip will be on field  after  turns.

// The diagram below depicts each field with an arrow pointing to the next field:

// There are four equiprobable initial fields, so each field has a  probability of being the chip's initial location. Next, we calculate the probability that the chip will end up in each field after  turn:

// The only way the chip ends up in this field is if it never jumps from the field, which only happens if Alex rolls a . So, this field's probability is . We then calculate and print the result of  on a new line.
// The chip can end up in field  after one turn in the following scenarios:

// Start in field  and roll a , the probability for which is .
// Start in field  and roll a  or a , the probability for which is .
// Start in field  and roll a , the probability for which is .
// After summing these probabilities, we get a total probability of  for the field. We then calculate and print the result of  on a new line.

// The chip can end up in field  after one turn in the following scenarios:

// Start in field  and roll a , the probability for which is .
// Start in field  and roll a , the probability for which is .
// Start in field  and roll a  or a , the probability for which is .
// After summing these probabilities, we get a total probability of  for the field. We then calculate and print the result of  on a new line.

// If the chip is initially placed in field , it will always end up in field  regardless of how many turns are taken (because this field loops back onto itself). Thus, this field's probability is . We then calculate and print the result of  on a new line.
