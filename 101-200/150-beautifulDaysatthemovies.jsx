// Lily likes to play games with integers. She has created a new game where she determines the difference between a number and its reverse. For instance, given the number , its reverse is . Their difference is . The number  reversed is , and their difference is .

// She decides to apply her game to decision making. She will look at a numbered range of days and will only go to a movie on a beautiful day.

// Given a range of numbered days,  and a number , determine the number of days in the range that are beautiful. Beautiful numbers are defined as numbers where  is evenly divisible by . If a day's value is a beautiful number, it is a beautiful day. Return the number of beautiful days in the range.

// Function Description

// Complete the beautifulDays function in the editor below.

// beautifulDays has the following parameter(s):

// int i: the starting day number
// int j: the ending day number
// int k: the divisor
// Returns

// int: the number of beautiful days in the range
// Input Format

// A single line of three space-separated integers describing the respective values of , , and .

// Constraints

// Sample Input

// 20 23 6
// Sample Output

// 2
// Explanation

// Lily may go to the movies on days , , , and . We perform the following calculations to determine which days are beautiful:

// Day  is beautiful because the following evaluates to a whole number:
// Day  is not beautiful because the following doesn't evaluate to a whole number:
// Day  is beautiful because the following evaluates to a whole number:
// Day  is not beautiful because the following doesn't evaluate to a whole number:
// Only two days,  and , in this interval are beautiful. Thus, we print  as our answer.

//Answer-150
