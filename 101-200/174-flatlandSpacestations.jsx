// Flatland is a country with a number of cities, some of which have space stations. Cities are numbered consecutively and each has a road of  length connecting it to the next city. It is not a circular route, so the first city doesn't connect with the last city. Determine the maximum distance from any city to its nearest space station.

// Example

// There are  cities and city  has a space station. They occur consecutively along a route. City  is  unit away and city  is  units away. City  is  units from its nearest space station as one is located there. The maximum distance is .

// Function Description

// Complete the flatlandSpaceStations function in the editor below.

// flatlandSpaceStations has the following parameter(s):

// int n: the number of cities
// int c[m]: the indices of cities with a space station
// Returns
// - int: the maximum distance any city is from a space station

// Input Format

// The first line consists of two space-separated integers,  and .
// The second line contains  space-separated integers, the indices of each city that has a space-station. These values are unordered and distinct.

// Constraints

// There will be at least  city with a space station.
// No city has more than one space station.
// Output Format

// Sample Input 0

// STDIN   Function
// -----   --------
// 5 2     n = 5, c[] size m = 2
// 0 4     c = [0, 4]
// Sample Output 0

// 2
// Explanation 0

// This sample corresponds to following graphic:

// hreasy(5).png

// The distance to the nearest space station for each city is listed below:

//  has distance , as it contains a space station.
//  has distance  to the space station in .
//  has distance  to the space stations in  and .
//  has distance  to the space station in .
//  has distance , as it contains a space station.
// We then take .

// Sample Input 1

// 6 6
// 0 1 2 4 3 5
// Sample Output 1

// 0
// Explanation 1

// In this sample,  so every city has space station and we print  as our answer.
