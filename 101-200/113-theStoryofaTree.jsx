// One day Bob drew a tree, , with  nodes and  edges on a piece of paper. He soon discovered that parent of a node depends on the root of the tree. The following images shows an example of that:

// image

// Learning the fact, Bob invented an exciting new game and decided to play it with Alice. The rules of the game is described below:

// Bob picks a random node to be the tree's root and keeps the identity of the chosen node a secret from Alice. Each node has an equal probability of being picked as the root.
// Alice then makes a list of  guesses, where each guess is in the form u v and means Alice guesses that  is true. It's guaranteed that an undirected edge connecting  and  exists in the tree.
// For each correct guess, Alice earns one point. Alice wins the game if she earns at least  points (i.e., at least  of her guesses were true).
// Alice and Bob play  games. Given the tree, Alice's guesses, and the value of  for each game, find the probability that Alice will win the game and print it on a new line as a reduced fraction in the format p/q.

// Input Format

// The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of different games. The subsequent lines describe each game in the following format:

// The first line contains an integer, , denoting the number of nodes in the tree.
// The  subsequent lines contain two space-separated integers,  and , defining an undirected edge between nodes  and .
// The next line contains two space-separated integers describing the respective values of  (the number of guesses) and  (the minimum score needed to win).
// Each of the  subsequent lines contains two space-separated integers,  and , indicating Alice guesses .
// Constraints

// The sum of  over all test cases won't exceed .
// No two guesses will be identical.
// Scoring

// For  of the maximum score, .
// For  of the maximum score, .
// Output Format

// Print the probability as a reduced fraction in the format p/q.

// Note: Print 0/1 if the probability is  and print 1/1 if the probability is .

// Alice and Bob play the following  games:

// Alice makes two guesses,  and , meaning she guessed that  and . To win the game, at least  of her guesses must be true.

// In the diagrams below, you can see that at least  guesses are true if the root of the tree is either node  or :

// image

// There are  nodes in total and the probability of picking node  or  as the root is , which reduces to .

// In this game, Alice only wins if node  is the root of the tree. There are  nodes in total, and the probability of picking node  as the root is .
