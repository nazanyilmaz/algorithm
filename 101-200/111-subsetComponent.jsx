// You are given an array with  -bit integers: .

// BIT(x, i) = (x >> i) & 1, where  is the  lower bit of  in binary form. If we regard every bit as a vertex of a graph G, there is an undirected edge between vertices  and  if there is a value  such that BIT(d[k], i) == 1 && BIT(d[k], j) == 1.

// For every subset of the input array, how many connected-components are there in that graph?

// A connected component in a graph is a set of nodes which are accessible to each other via a path of edges. There may be multiple connected components in a graph.

// Example

// In the real challenge, there will be  nodes associated with each integer in  represented as a  bit binary value. For clarity, only  bits will be shown in the example but all  will be considered in the calculations.

//     Decimal  Binary Edges   Node ends
//     d[0] = 1   0001   0
//     d[1] = 2   0010   0
//     d[2] = 3   0011   1       0 and 1
//     d[3] = 5   0101   1       0 and 2
// Consider all subsets:

//                  Edges
//     Subset   Count  Nodes  Connected components
//     {1}         0           64
//     {2}         0           64
//     {3}         1   0-1     63
//     {5}         1   0-2     63
//     {1,2}       0           64
//     {1,3}       1   0-1     63
//     {1,5}       1   0-2     63
//     {2,3}       1   0-1     63
//     {2,5}       1   0-2     63
//     {3,5}       2   0-1-2   62
//     {1,2,3}     1   0-1     63
//     {1,2,5}     1   0-2     63
//     {1,3,5}     2   0-1-2   62

//     {1,2,3,5}   2   0-1-2   62
//     Sum                    944
// The values  and  have  bits set, so they have  edge each. If a subset contains only a  or , there will be one connected component with  nodes, and  components with  node for a total of .

// If both  and  are in a subset,  component with nodes  and  is formed since node  is one end of each edge described. The other  nodes are solitary, so there are  connected components total.

// All other values have only  bit set, so they have no edges. They have  components with  node each.

// int: the sum of the number of connected components for all subsets of
// Input Format

// The first row contains the integer , the size of .
// The next row has  space-separated integers, .

// Explanation 1

// There are  subset of .

// {}
// => We don't have any number in this subset => no edge in the graph => Every node is a component by itself => Number of connected-components = 64.

// {2}
// => The Binary Representation of 2 is . There is a bit at only one position. => So there is no edge in the graph, every node is a connected-component by itself => Number of connected-components = 64.

// {5}
// => The Binary Representation of 5 is . There is a bit at the 0th and 2nd position. => So there is an edge: (0, 2) in the graph => There is one component with a pair of nodes (0,2) in the graph. Apart from that, all remaining 62 vertices are indepenent components of one node each (1,3,4,5,6...63) => Number of connected-components = 63.

// {9}
// => The Binary Representation of 9 is . => There is a 1-bit at the 0th and 3rd position in this binary representation. => edge: (0, 3) in the graph => Number of components = 63

// {2, 5}
// => This will contain the edge (0, 2) in the graph which will form one component
// => Other nodes are all independent components
// => Number of connected-component = 63

// {2, 9}
// => This has edge (0,3) in the graph
// => Similar to examples above, this has 63 connected components

// {5, 9}
// => This has edges (0, 2) and (0, 3) in the graph
// => Similar to examples above, this has 62 connected components

// {2, 5, 9}
// => This has edges(0, 2) (0, 3) in the graph. All three vertices (0,2,3) make one component => Other 61 vertices are all independent components
// => Number of connected-components = 62
