// A jail has a number of prisoners and a number of treats to pass out to them. Their jailer decides the fairest way to divide the treats is to seat the prisoners around a circular table in sequentially numbered chairs. A chair number will be drawn from a hat. Beginning with the prisoner in that chair, one candy will be handed to each prisoner sequentially around the table until all have been distributed.

// The jailer is playing a little joke, though. The last piece of candy looks like all the others, but it tastes awful. Determine the chair number occupied by the prisoner who will receive that candy.

// Example

// There are  prisoners,  pieces of candy and distribution starts at chair . The prisoners arrange themselves in seats numbered  to . Prisoners receive candy at positions . The prisoner to be warned sits in chair number .

// Function Description

// Complete the saveThePrisoner function in the editor below. It should return an integer representing the chair number of the prisoner to warn.

// saveThePrisoner has the following parameter(s):

// int n: the number of prisoners
// int m: the number of sweets
// int s: the chair number to begin passing out sweets from
// Returns

// int: the chair number of the prisoner to warn
// Input Format

// The first line contains an integer, , the number of test cases.
// The next  lines each contain  space-separated integers:

// : the number of prisoners
// : the number of sweets
// : the chair number to start passing out treats at
// Constraints

// Sample Input 0

// 2
// 5 2 1
// 5 2 2
// Sample Output 0

// 2
// 3
// Explanation 0

// In the first query, there are  prisoners and  sweets. Distribution starts at seat number . Prisoners in seats numbered  and  get sweets. Warn prisoner .

// In the second query, distribution starts at seat  so prisoners in seats  and  get sweets. Warn prisoner .

// Sample Input 1

// 2
// 7 19 2
// 3 7 3
// Sample Output 1

// 6
// 3
// Explanation 1

// In the first test case, there are  prisoners,  sweets and they are passed out starting at chair . The candies go all around twice and there are  more candies passed to each prisoner from seat  to seat .

// In the second test case, there are  prisoners,  candies and they are passed out starting at seat . They go around twice, and there is one more to pass out to the prisoner at seat .
