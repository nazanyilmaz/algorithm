// Given a graph which consists of several edges connecting its nodes, find a subgraph of the given graph with the following properties:

// The subgraph contains all the nodes present in the original graph.
// The subgraph is of minimum overall weight (sum of all edges) among all such subgraphs.
// It is also required that there is exactly one, exclusive path between any two nodes of the subgraph.
// One specific node  is fixed as the starting point of finding the subgraph using Prim's Algorithm.
// Find the total weight or the sum of all edges in the subgraph.

// Example

// image

// Starting from node , select the lower weight edge, i.e. , weight .

// Choose between the remaining edges, , weight , and , weight .

// The lower weight edge is  weight .

// All nodes are connected at a cost of . The edge  is not included in the subgraph.

// Function Description

// Complete the prims function in the editor below.

// prims has the following parameter(s):

// int n: the number of nodes in the graph
// int edges[m][3]: each element contains three integers, two nodes numbers that are connected and the weight of that edge
// int start: the number of the starting node
// Returns

// int: the minimum weight to connect all nodes in the graph
// Input Format

// The first line has two space-separated integers  and , the number of nodes and edges in the graph.

// Each of the next  lines contains three space-separated integers ,  and , the end nodes of , and the edge's weight.
// The last line has an integer , the starting node.

// Constraints

// There may be multiple edges between two nodes.

// Sample Input 0

// 5 6
// 1 2 3
// 1 3 4
// 4 2 6
// 5 2 2
// 2 3 5
// 3 5 7
// 1
// Sample Output 0

// 15
// Explanation 0

// The graph given in the test case is shown as :

// image

// The starting node is  (in the given test case)
// Applying the Prim's algorithm, edge choices available at first are :

//  (WT. 3) and  (WT. 4) , out of which  is chosen (smaller weight of edge).

// Now the available choices are :

//  (WT. 4) ,  (WT. 5) ,  (WT. 2) and  (WT. 6) , out of which  is chosen by the algorithm.

// Following the same method of the algorithm, the next chosen edges , sequentially are :

//  and .

// Hence the overall sequence of edges picked up by Prim's are:

// and the total weight of the MST (minimum spanning tree) is :
