// Priyanka works for an international toy company that ships by container. Her task is to the determine the lowest cost way to combine her orders for shipping. She has a list of item weights. The shipping company has a requirement that all items loaded in a container must weigh less than or equal to 4 units plus the weight of the minimum weight item. All items meeting that requirement will be shipped in one container.

// What is the smallest number of containers that can be contracted to ship the items based on the given list of weights?

// For example, there are items with weights . This can be broken into two containers:  and . Each container will contain items weighing within  units of the minimum weight item.

// Function Description

// Complete the toys function in the editor below. It should return the minimum number of containers required to ship.

// toys has the following parameter(s):

// w: an array of integers that represent the weights of each order to ship
// Input Format

// The first line contains an integer , the number of orders to ship.
// The next line contains  space-separated integers, , representing the orders in a weight array.

// Constraints

// Output Format

// Return the integer value of the number of containers Priyanka must contract to ship all of the toys.

// Sample Input

// 8
// 1 2 3 21 7 12 14 21
// Sample Output

// 4
// Explanation

// The first container holds items weighing ,  and . (weights in range )
// The second container holds the items weighing  units. ()
// The third container holds the item weighing  units. ()
// The fourth container holds the items weighing  and  units. ()

//  containers are required.
