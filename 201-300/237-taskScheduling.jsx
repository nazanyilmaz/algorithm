// You have a long list of tasks that you need to do today. To accomplish task  you need  minutes, and the deadline for this task is . You need not complete a task at a stretch. You can complete a part of it, switch to another task, and then switch back.

// You've realized that it might not be possible to complete all the tasks by their deadline. So you decide to do them in such a manner that the maximum amount by which a task's completion time overshoots its deadline is minimized.

// Input Format

// The first line contains the number of tasks, . Each of the next  lines contains two integers,  and .

// Constraints

// Output Format

// Output  lines. The  line contains the value of the maximum amount by which a task's completion time overshoots its deadline, when the first  tasks on your list are scheduled optimally. See the sample input for clarification.

// Sample Input

// 5
// 2 2
// 1 1
// 4 3
// 10 1
// 2 1
// Sample Output

// 0
// 1
// 2
// 2
// 3
// Explanation

// The first task alone can be completed in 2 minutes, and so you won't overshoot the deadline.

// With the first two tasks, the optimal schedule can be:
// time 1: task 2
// time 2: task 1
// time 3: task 1

// We've overshot task 1 by 1 minute, hence returning 1.

// With the first three tasks, the optimal schedule can be:
// time 1 : task 2
// time 2 : task 1
// time 3 : task 3
// time 4 : task 1
// time 5 : task 3
// time 6 : task 3

// Task 1 has a deadline 2, and it finishes at time 4. So it exceeds its deadline by 2.
// Task 2 has a deadline 1, and it finishes at time 1. So it exceeds its deadline by 0.
// Task 3 has a deadline 4, and it finishes at time 6. So it exceeds its deadline by 2.

// Thus, the maximum time by which you overshoot a deadline is 2. No schedule can do better than this.

// Similar calculation can be done for the case containing 5 tasks.
